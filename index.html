<h1 style="font-size:100px;"> DJing! </h1>
<p> In my spare time I enjoy producing and DJing electronic music <br> I think it is great fun. </p>

<p> Some of my favourite places to watch/listen to great Dj sets are... <ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KeepHush">Keep Hush</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rinsefm">Rinse FM</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DJMag">DJ Mag</a>
    </li>
</ul><br> Keep Hush is a similar concept to 'Boiler Room' but it platforms a broader specrtum of underground music, which makes it more appealing to me. <br>
Rinse FM is a legendary London based radio station that is one of the beacons of undeground UK music. <br>
Lastly, DJ Mag, is a monthly magazine all about the world of electronic music and DJ's.
